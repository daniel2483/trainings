System Backup

dd - data duplicator

5 types of backups:
1. System backup (entire image using tools such as acronis, Veeam, Commvault, etc)
2. Application backup (3rd party app backup solution)
3. Database backup (Oracle dataguard, SQL backup, etc)
4. Filesystem backup (tar, gzip directories, etc)
5. Disk backup or disk cloning (dd command)

dd is a command utility for Unix and Unix-like OS whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files

As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backuing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining a fixed amount of random data

Please note the source and dest disk should be the same size

To backup or clone an entire disk to another hard disk connected to the same system, execute the dd command as shown:

# dd if=<source_file_name> of=<target_file_name> [options]
Example:
# dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb

To backup/copy the disk partition:
# dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/root/sda1.img

Restoring this image file to other machine after copying the .img
# dd if=/root/sda1.img of=/dev/sdb3
