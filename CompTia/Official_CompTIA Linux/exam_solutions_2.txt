the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one
that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and
one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
EOF

A here document is a redirection technique that allows you to send a large chunk of data to a command. A cat command by itself does not provide this feature. There is no such thing as a EOF file or a marker, at least in terms of this feature.

When set on executable files, suid allows a program to access files using the permissions of the user owner of the executable file. When set on executable files, sgid allows a program to access files using the permissions of the group owner of the executable file. When sgid is set on directories, all new files in the directory inherit the group ownership of the directory. When the sticky bit is set on directories, files in the directory can only be removed by the user owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the root user. sdid is not a valid term.

Returns unsuccessful: If the current PAM module returns
unsuccessful, the next rule is checked in the list. If this is the final
rule, the stack returns with a value of successful (except when a
previous requisite rule is unsuccessful).

The description refers to the sufficient control value. The required, requisite, and optional control values have different behaviors.

Which kernel parameter is used to change the scheduler to follow the FIFO principle?
noop follows the FIFO (first-in, first-out) principle. CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing) has a separate queue for each process, and the queues are served in a continuous loop. Deadline is the standard scheduler; it creates two queues, a read queue and a write queue. It also puts a timestamp on each I/O request to ensure that requests are handled in a timely manner. Truncate is not a valid scheduler.
