Firewall

Firewall rules

2 Types of firewalls in IT
	- Software which runs in OS
	- hardware which is a dedicated appliance with FW software

Server A to Server B

iptables mostly used
firewalld is newer


It can run one or the other

Before working with iptables
systemctl stop firewalld	- To stop service
systemctl disable firewalld	- To prevent from starting at boot time
systemctl mask firewalld	- To prevent if from running by other programs or to not start it by accident

Check if is installed
rpm -qa | grep iptables-services
yum install iptables-services

To check rules:
iptables -L

To flush iptables:
iptables -F


Function of iptables is packet filtering
tables, chains and targets

tables= is something that allows you to process packets in specific ways. There are 4 different types: filter, mangle, nat and raw


chains= The chains are attached to tables. These chains allow to inspect traffic. 3 main chains
# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

	Rule= if traffic is coming from x.x.x.x then go to target


targets= target decides the fate of a packet, allowing or rejecting. 3 different type:
	ACCEPT
	DROP
	REJECT

prot: tcp,upd,icmp or all
opt: IP options

Firewall
	firewall-cmd

	predefined service: NFS, NTP, HTTPD etc
	
	Also has
	Table
	Chains
	Rules
	Targets
		DROP
		REJECT
		ACCEPT

	
systemctl stop iptables
systemctl disable iptables
systemctl mask iptables


(systemctl unmask iptables) to unmask a service


systemctl start/enable firewalld

firewall-cmd --list-all
firewall-cmd --get-services
firewall-cmd --reload


Examples:
Multiple zones:
firewall-cmd --get-zones

Active zones:
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

Firewall rules:
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all

3rd pary service:
/usr/lib/firewalld/services/allservices.xml
copy any .xml file and change the service and port number

add a service (http):
firewall-cmd --add-service=http


To remove a service:
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http

To reload the firewall config
firewall-cmd --reload


To add or remove a service permanently
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http --permanent

To add a service that is not pre-defined by firewalld
/usr/lib/firewalld/services/allservices.xml
do a copy and change service and port
systemctl restart firewalld
firewall-cmd --get-services
firewall-cmd --add-service=<name>
<name> should exists

To add/remove a port
firewall-cmd --add-port=1110/tcp
firewall-cmd --remove-port=1110/tcp

To add a port permanently
firewall-cmd --add-port=1110/tcp --permanent

To reject incoming traffic from an IP Address
firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="x.x.x.x" reject'

To block ICMP traffic incoming traffic
firewall-cmd --add-icmp-block-inversion
firewall-cmd --remove-icmp-block-inversion

To block outgoing traffic to specific web/ip address
host -t a www.facebook.com
firewall-cmd --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter OUTPUT 0 -d 31.13.93.35 -j DROP

the 0 is disable
