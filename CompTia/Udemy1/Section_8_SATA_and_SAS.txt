SATA and SAS


Drives

SATA - Serial Advanced Techonology Attachement
SAS - Serial Attached SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)

Bot utilize serial communication, it means the highway has both lanes

Main difference between is that SAS drives are faster and more reliable that SATA drives

SAS is generally more expensive and it's better suited for use in servers or in processing-heavy computer workstations. SATA is less expensive, and it's better suited for desktop file storage

In a SATA cable, all 4 wires are plaed within the same cable. In a SAS cable, the 4 wires are separated into 2 different cables

Why?
So you can connect more devices to one another. With SATA cable, you can only link the motherboard and storage drive. You could hook up an expansion device, but that takes up valuable room inside your computer.

With SAS cable, you can hook up the motherboard to both a storage drive and another piece of hardware that has SAS connectors.
