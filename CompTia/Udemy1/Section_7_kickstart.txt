Automate linux installation

No intervention from user
- Language and time zone
- How drives should partitioned
- Which packages should be installed


Purpose?
What happen if needs to install on 1000000 servers


To use kickstart
1. Choose kickstart server and create/edit a kickstart file
2. Make a kickstart file available on a network location
3. Make the installation source available (ISO file)
4. Make boot media available for client which will be used to begin the installation
5. Start the kickstart installation

CentOS/RHEL 7
- Can be downloaded which allows you to define parameters through the GUI
yum install system-config-kickstart

- Or you can use the installation kickstart file which was createdf during the first installation (anaconda-ks.cfg)


CentOS/RHEL 8
There is no GUI availble to edit the file

Why change?
Most systems are virtual and templates can be used
Automation software are in used such as Ansible

1. identify the server

2. Take a snapshot of the server

3. Install kickstart configurator (for version 7)
	yum install system-config-kickstart

4. Start the kickstart file configurator and define parameters OR use the /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
	The GUI system-config-kickstart
	anaconda is the name of the installation wizard of the Linux installation Linux

5. Make sure httpd package is installed
	rpm -qa | grep http
	yum/dnf install httpd

	systemctl status httpd
	systemctl start httpd
	systemctl enable httpd

6. Copy kickstart file to httpd directory and change the permissions
	copy /root/anaconda-ks.cfg /var/www/html ---> Default directory of httpd
	chmod a+r /var/www/html/anaconda-ks.cfg
	systemctl stop|disable firewalld
	sestatus
	Check the file is acccesable from http://x.x.x.x/anaconda-ks.cfg

7. Create a new VM and attach the CentOS iso image
	
8. Change the network adapter to Bridged adapter

9. In GRUB hit escape

10. boot: linux ks=http://x.x.x.x/anaconda-ks.cfg
	for NFS > boot: linux inst.ks=nfs:x.x.x.x:/rhel8

11. Wait and enjoy the automated installation
	At the end will show the Summary installation


If Kickstart needs to be run on static IP servers
boot: linux ks=http://x.x.x.x/anaconda-ks.cfg ksdevice=eth0 IP:192.168.1.50 netmask=255.255.255.0 gateway=192.168.1.1
