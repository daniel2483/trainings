Optimize performance using tuned daemon
Prioritize or de-prioritize processes with nice and renice

tuned --> daemon
It is systemd service that is used to tune Linux system performance
It is installed in CentOS/RedHat version 7 and 8 by default

tuned package name is tuned, with pre-defined profiles and settings

automatically adjust system to get the best performance.
Example: tuned will adjust networking if you are downloading a large file or it will adjust IO settings if detects high storage read/write


rpm -qa | grep tuned

systemctl status|enable|start|stop tuned

Command to change setting for tuned daemon
tuned-adm

To check active profile
tuned-adm active

To list all available profiles
tuned-adm list

# tuned-adm active
Current active profile: virtual-guest
# tuned-adm list
Available profiles:
- balanced                    - General non-specialized tuned profile
- desktop                     - Optimize for the desktop use-case
- hpc-compute                 - Optimize for HPC compute workloads
- latency-performance         - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption
- network-latency             - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance
- network-throughput          - Optimize for streaming network throughput, generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks
- powersave                   - Optimize for low power consumption
- throughput-performance      - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads
- virtual-guest               - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest
- virtual-host                - Optimize for running KVM guests
Current active profile: virtual-guest

nice from -20 to 19 (lowest priority)

processes inherit nice prioirity

top

PR > System priority level RT -99 to 39
NI > -20 to 19, nice value is a user-space and PR is a the process's actual priority that use by Linux kernel

Linux priorities are 0 to 139, 0 to 99 for real time and 100 to 139 for users


ps axo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice

To set the process priority
nice -n # process-name
Ex:
nice -n -15 top


To change the process priority
renice -n # process-name
Ex:
renice -n 12 PID
