RAID

Redundant Array of Independent Disks

RAID 0 - one disk and add a new disk, this increase the size 

RAID 1 - Eliminate the disadvantage . One disk and another disk and creates a mirroring. This is slow. 

RAID 5 - One disk, cop everything on second disk, but needs to have 3 or more disks
