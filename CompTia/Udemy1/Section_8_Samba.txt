Samba Installation and Configuration:

Is a linux tool or utility that allows sharing for Linux resources such as files and printers to with other operating systems

Works exactly like NFS but the difference is NFS shares within Linux or Unix like system whereas Samba shares with other OS (Windows, MAC, etc)

Samba (smb vs CIFS)

Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) which was invented by IBM.

Another protocol used to share Samba is through CIFS (Common Internet File System) invented by Microsoft and NMB (NetBios Named Server)

CIFS became the extension of SMB and now Microsoft has introduced newer version of SMB v2 and v3 that are mostly used in the industry

In simple term, most people, when they use either SMB or CIFS, are talking about the same exact thing.
