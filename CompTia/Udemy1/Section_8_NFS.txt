Network File System (NFS)

Developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc

Its a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and treat it as a local file directory.

Steps for NFS Server Configuration

1- Install NFS packages
# yum install nfs-utils libnfsidmap

2- Enable and start NFS services
# systemctl enable rpcbind
# systemctl enable nfs-server
# systemctl start rpcbind, nfs-server, rpc-statd, nfs-idmapd

3- Create NFS directory and assign permissions
# mkdir /mypretzels
# chmod a+rwx /mypretzels

4- Modify /etc/exports file
# /mypretzels 192.168.12.7(rw,sync,no_root_squash) = for only 1 host

rw- Read/write
sync- all changes to the according filesystem are immediately flushed to disk; the respective write operations are being waited for
no_root_squash- Root on client machine will have the same level of access to the files on the system as root on the server.

To all computers
# /mypretzels *(rw,sync,no_root_squash) = for everyone

5- Export the NFS filesystem:
# exportfs -rv
-r republished
-v verbose mode

Steps for NFS Client Configuration

1- Install the packages
yum install nfs-utils rpcbind

2- Enable and restart the services
service rpcbind start
service rpcbind enable
service nfs-utils start
service nfs-utils enable

3- Make sure firewalld or iptables stopped (if running)
# ps -fe | egrep "firewalld|iptable"

4- Show mount from NFS server
# showmount -e 192.168.1.5 (NFS server IP)

5- Create a mount point
# mkdir /mnt/app

6- Mount the NFS filesystem
# mount 192.168.1.5:/mypretzels /mnt/app

7- Verify mounted filesystem
# df -kh

8- To unmount
# umount /mnt/app
