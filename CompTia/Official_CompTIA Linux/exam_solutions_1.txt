Explanation:
The values of a line in the rsyslog.conf are facility.priority action.

The combination of facility and priority is called the selector. For the example in the question, uucp,news.crit is the selector, uucp,news is the facility, crit is the priority, and /var/log/spooler is the action.

facility	priority	action
uucp,news.	crit 		/var/log/spooler


The logrotate command is a utility designed to ensure that the partition holding the log files has enough room to handle them. Log file size increases over time. The logrotate command rotates log files over time to limit the filesystem space that the logs use. The syslogd, journald, and rsyslogd commands create log files; they don't ensure that the partition has enough room.

Which of the following features are valid targets for the iptables command?
ACCEPT
LOG


Targets

    -j RETURN: will cause the current packet to stop traveling through the chain (or sub-chain)
    -j ACCEPT : the rule is accepted and will not continue traversing the current chain or any other ones in the same table. Note however, that a packet that was accepted in one chain might still travel through chains within other tables, and could still be dropped there
    -j DNAT : only available within PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains in the nat table, and any of the chains called upon from any of those listed chains
    -j SNAT: valid only in nat table, within the POSTROUTING chain
    -j DROP: Drops the packet, right there right then
    -j REJECT: Sends a response back (unlike drop). Valid in the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains or their sub chains
    -j LOG: Note: Does not work on namespaces. Also can fill up your kernel log.

      	iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j LOG --log-prefix "INPUT packets"

    -j ULOG: packet information is multicasted together with the whole packet through a netlink socket. One or more user-space processes may then subscribe to various multicast groups and receive the packet
    -j MARK: Only valid in mangle table. Note that the mark value is not set within the actual package, but is a value that is associated within the kernel with the packet. In other words does not make it out of the machine

    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j MARK --set-mark 2

    -j MASQUERADE: Similar to SNAT but used on a outbound network interface when the outbound IP can change. Say a DHCP interface Only valid within the POSTROUTING
    -j REDIRECT: redirect packets and streams to the machine itself. Valid within the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains of the nat table. It is also valid within user-defined chains that are only called from those chains


Which range includes all of the ports that are considered privileged ports?
